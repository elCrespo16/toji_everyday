# Instagram Media Uploader Project

This project automates the daily uploading of media to Instagram using the `instagrapi` library. The project consists of multiple scripts to handle media files, configurations, and the automation of uploads.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the `ffmpeg` library to support video uploads

The recommended python version is 3.11.3

As usual, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. I use `pyenv` to manage my virtual environments.

## Directory Preparation Script

The following script prepares a directory for use with the Instagram media uploading project. It assumes the directory contains a single media file, renames that file to "media," and creates a `config.yaml` file with default configurations.

### Usage

Run the script using the following command:

python prepare_dir.py /path/to/directory

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the path to the directory you want to prepare.

### Steps Performed by the Script

1. **Change Working Directory:** The script changes the working directory to the specified directory.

2. **Get File Name:** It identifies the name of the only file in the directory.

3. **Rename the File:** The script renames the file to "media" to ensure consistency with the media loader script.

4. **Create `config.yaml`:** It creates a `config.yaml` file in the directory with default configurations generated from the `Config` class in the `media_loader.py` script.

## Media Loader

The `media_loader.py` script handles media files and their configurations. It supports both images and videos, with optional features like daily stories and easter eggs.

### Configuration

Refer to the provided `media_loader.py` README section for details on how to organize your media files, configure media settings, and use the media loader script.

## Main Uploading Script (main.py)

The `main.py` script automates the daily uploading of media to Instagram. It uses the `instagrapi` library for Instagram interactions and sends notifications via Telegram.

### Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

USERNAME=your_instagram_username
PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id

Replace the placeholders with your Instagram credentials, Telegram bot token, and chat ID.

2. Organize your media files into directories within the `media` directory.

3. Customize the `DEFAULT_CAPTION` in `media_loader.py` to fit your preferences.

4. Run the `main.py` script using the following command:

python main.py

### Notes

- The script uses the `instagrapi` library for Instagram interactions.
- Session information is stored in `session.json` for persistent login.
- Notifications are sent via Telegram to the specified chat ID using a Telegram bot.

# Automating Daily Uploads with Cron Job

To automate the daily uploading of media to Instagram, set up a cron job as follows:

1. Open the crontab configuration file for editing:
```bash
crontab -e
```
2. Add the following line to run the upload script every day at 11:00 AM:
```cron
0 11 * * * cd $HOME/toji_everyday && ./upload.sh
```
This cron job changes to the project directory and executes the upload.sh script.
# Upload Script (upload.sh)
To facilitate the daily uploads, a Bash script (upload.sh) has been provided. Follow these steps to use the script:

1. Create a new file named upload.sh in your project directory.

2. Copy and paste the following content into upload.sh, this script is supposed to use pyenv to activate the virtual environment and execute the main.py script. You can customize it to fit your project setup.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Source your bashrc or any necessary environment setup
source /path_to/.bashrc

# Change to the project directory
cd /path_to/toji_everyday

# Activate the virtual environment using pyenv
pyenv activate toji_everyday

# Execute the main.py script and log the output to toji_logs.log
pyenv exec python main.py >> toji_logs.log
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x upload.sh
```

Now, you can rely on the cron job to automatically upload media to Instagram every day at the specified time.

## Notes
- Make sure to customize the paths and filenames in the scripts based on your project setup.
- Adjust the cron schedule (0 11 * * *) according to your desired daily upload time.
